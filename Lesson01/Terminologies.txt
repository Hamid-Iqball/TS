Strongly Typed Languages: Demand the specfication of data types and that is what we do in TS, TS is strongly typed language and we have to exclusively specify what type for data.

Loosly typed Language: It does not require type specfication Js is loosly typed language.

A languge that is strongly typed can be either statically or dyanmically typed.TS is statically typed which means types are checked at compile time.

Js is dyanmically types language this means types are checked at run time.

When Ts does not figure out what type your value is, it assigned type "Any" to it.
